/**
 * The game played by a monkey: the real game, without the picture, made to
 * do at random everything a player can make happen, and checked after every
 * few frames for anything that must always hold and does not
 * (`invariants.ts`), and for anything thrown. On an empty course a player
 * can wait, and can reload, and that is all there is here yet.
 *
 * Only what a player could do. A monkey that did what no player can would
 * find bugs no player will. A new thing a player can do gets an action here.
 *
 * From a seed, so a failure can be played again exactly: `npm run fuzz --
 * --seed N` does, and prints what was done before it went wrong.
